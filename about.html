            </div>
            <div class="p">
                <p>I was born in Drogheda, Louth, the smallest county in Ireland the day after Christmas 2004; inconvenient, sorry mam.</p>
                <p>I have no brothers or siblings and was gifted independence at a young age.</p>
                <p>Sports were very important to me, I would play football all the times, I would bring my ball and dribble it in shops.</p>
                <p>When i was 11, I went to Spain with my mam. One day when I was there I drank 7 fantas and I haven't had fizzy drink since then.</p>
                <p>In 2020 as a new years resolution I said I wouldn't eat any added sugar, and I haven't since.</p>
                <p>I was very good at school, I always got good grades and loved it, I didn't like the weekends.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 2022 I finished school, I wasnt't sure what exactly I wanted to do in college so I took a year out.<p>
                <p>I went to my family America and worked 2 full-time jobs and I loved it.</p>
                <p>Becuase of this, I studied nonstop for 6 months and passed the educational requirements to get my Real estate licnese in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>I saw real estate as a perfect career path for me:</p>
                <p class="smallFont">I didn't need to go to college,</p>
                <p class="smallFont">I could work 80+ hours,</p>
                <p class="smallFont">I could make loads of money.</p>
                <p>But while studying in America, away from friends and family I grew up with, I realized there's more to life than money.</p>
                <p>I've always been interested in Finance and Technology.</p>
                <p>I opened a ROTH IRA and 3 credit cards on my 18th birthday.</p>
                <p>My plan now is to go to college double major in computer science and business, get a masters in computer science then work for a great company.</p>
                <p>I want to work on a team developing cutting edge technology. I want to help change peoples lives for the good.</p>
