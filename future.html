                <p>The future is the reason I do everything. I can't wait to go to college, meet new people, work, and discover the world.</p>
                <p>I don't believe there's a 'purpose' for my life. I want to understand as much as I can, which is why I always ask 'why?'.</p>
                <p>I think life is one paragraph, not a collection of chapters.</p>
                <p>My current plan is to go to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Double major in Computer Science and Business.</li>
                    <li>Take online courses oriented around data science.</li>
                    <li>Get as much experience in those fields through internships.</li>
                    <li>Get a masters in Computer Science.</li>
                    <li>Work at Tesla, Apple, Google, Microsoft or Nvidia.</li>
                    <li>Start my own project in the field I work in.</li>
                    <li>Generate loads of wealth and become the biggest philanthropist.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That's my life plan</p>
                <p>I want to be 120, sitting outside in a rocking chair with my wife, around our great great grandkids answering their questions of what I did after school and be proud of the 100 years of work I put in.</p>
